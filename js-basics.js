// Alright here's an exercise for you, I want you to write a function that takes two numbers and returns the maximum of the two. Call that function, give a different argument, and make sure it's working properly.
function max(num1, num2){
    if (num1 > num2){
        return num1;
    }
    else{
        return num2
    }
}
console.log(max(8, 10))

// FizzBuzz is a task where the programmer is asked to print numbers from 1 to 100, but here’s the catch, multiple of three should print “Fizz” and similarly print “Buzz” for multiples of 5 and lastly print “FizzBuzz” for multiples of three and five.
